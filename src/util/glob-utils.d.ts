 * Patterns use a limited glob format:
 * `**` matches 0 or more path segments
 * `*` matches 0 or more characters excluding `/`
 * `?` matches exactly one character excluding `/` (but when @param literalQuestionMark is true, `?` is treated as normal character)
 * The `!` prefix marks the pattern as being negative, meaning that only URLs that don't match the pattern will be included
 *
 * @param glob glob-like pattern
 * @param literalQuestionMark when true, it tells that `?` is treated as a normal character
